                                                      📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

📁 Project Overview - 
This project is part of Task 5 in the virtual internship program. The goal is to explore and understand the Titanic dataset using Python-based tools and extract meaningful insights using statistical and visual techniques.

✅ Objectives - 

1. To perform data cleaning and inspection
2. To visualize data distribution and relationships
3. To derive key insights that can guide further predictive modeling

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used - 

Python
Pandas – For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib – For basic visualizations
Seaborn – For advanced statistical plots
Jupyter Notebook – For interactive development and documentation

📂 Dataset Used - 

Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or any relevant source)
Contains data about passengers such as age, sex, fare, class, and survival status

🔍 Key Steps Performed - 

1. Data Loading and Inspection
Used .info(), .describe(), .head(), .value_counts() to understand data structure

2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'
Converted categorical variables to suitable formats if needed

3. Univariate Analysis
Histograms and boxplots for Age, Fare
Countplots for categorical features like Sex, Pclass, Embarked

4. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Used sns.heatmap() to check correlations
Created sns.pairplot() to examine feature interactions
Scatterplots and group-by analysis to compare survival rates across groups

Observations - 

1. Females and children had a higher survival rate
2. Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival
3. Fare and Pclass were strong indicators of survival

📝 Deliverables - 

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with code and inline observations
PDF report summarizing all visualizations and findings
This README file for project documentation

📌 Conclusion - 

This EDA helped uncover trends, correlations, and potential features that are useful for predictive modeling. It forms a strong base for applying machine learning models in the next stages.
